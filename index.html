    <p>In this phase i remember nothing but as i have heard from my mother she used to say me that i started walking late compared to my sister but i was walking fast like grown up child and also my words were very clear unlike other children of that age..</p>
    <center><h2 style="background-color: rgb(22, 94, 94);font-size: 22px; color: whitesmoke;">6-10 Years</h2></center>
<P> This phase i was very naughty doing all kind of mischevious things, my father first time shown me how to play football game which became
    my all time favorite game and i was quick learner, i learnt bicycle in 3 days and was always bringing home 
fights from other kids parents,which was a headache for my mother, suddenly after 8 yeasr of age i became silent and 
was not picking up fights, turned into a good boy.  </P>

<p> In this phase it was all about games, i was into all kind of games cricket, football, badminton, karate, the moment i come from school my mother used to say that i would throw out bag
    and run to the ground, this phase was not all joyful i was loosing my best friends which was very painful as we would
fight in cricket and some new friends would take my place as best friends. As everyone just entered teenage 
new energy, new crush's. In school i was not topper but good at science, maths and social poor at languages.
Finished 10th class board exams in first class, later entered into college. </p>

<p>As usual this was the period of college fun,no proper career direction,was learning many new things from friends, bunking classes
teasing girls,watching movies, at the same time i was good at studies because i could grasp things quickly,
though i would not spend hours to study, i would secure good marks, but the only thing was no goal or ambiton
was there, i cleared EAMCET exam based on the rank i took pharmacy which was turning point in my life,
i studied in kadapa and made there my life buddies, my most memorable days were those graduation days.
from ther went to do my masters in ooty where i met love of my life.</p>
<center><h2 style="background-color: rgb(22, 94, 94);font-size: 22px; color: whitesmoke;">26-35 Years</h2></center>
<p>This phase of my life is the most serious phase where i joined Delhi coaching centers for UPSC as i had only 
    option for my parents to accept my love, this was the most regretiing step i could imagine as i wasted 
my valuable 8 years of most precious time in preparation to competitive exams, i finally got married to my love but still struggling 
to settle, now i am learning React js to settle in some job. </p>
